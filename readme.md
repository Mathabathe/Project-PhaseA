Objectives of the project	
		
The goals of the website##		
		
The website will be created in such a way that it will allows the future improvements and modification making use		
of object oriented language in PHP. The whole aim is to design a website that has the capabilities of shopping cart.
That means a user is allowed to purchase Chairs on-line which would involve ordinary daily transaction but in more advance and secured way.
This leads us to the concept that all transactions will still provide the generation of invoice and email notification. 
What this system will be able to do is produce reports, sale summaries and customers order history.		
		
Customers benefits		
		
They will be able to view their price catalogues and order statuses. Being privileged to create order and create 
customised order of chairs.Allow them to perform their search of items sufficiently and accurately. 
Another important feature is to view the chairs on-line. We are offering user friendly interface that is easy to learn and use. 
Mainly the we be able to register and sign in clients to personalised ordering.		
		
Administrator benefits		
		
They have the right to alter the contents of the website, such as changing prices of chairs, removing chairs that are no longer in production
and have new chairs added to the catalogue. A number of user can be giving access		
to certain pages which covers the idea of user privileges. They can monitor the progress of the revenue in the company as well		
as their chairs. An important feature is contacting our customers by the means		
of emails and newsletter or even directly, this will strengthen the relationship.		
		
Market and competitors		
		
Our potential market are Corporate Companies, public services, Institutions and public Customers.
 Our competitors are Local Companies and international Companies that provides similar services.		
		
Marketing methods	
		
We allow our customer to view and order Chairs on line. When an order is placed, the goods have to be transported to the client.
Discounts for the companies varies in the range firstly the loyalty of the customer, secondly the quantity of the goods being ordered.
Special promotions will be ran in holidays for specials type of chairs suitable for the season.
Newly Manufactured Chairs, we invite our Customers to come join us in the launching of them.  		
 Now how we tend to promote our company is the means of having banners on other stores.
 We tend to have a sales staff that will ensure that all strategies are implemented.
 But our whole goal is to make the public know that we are as reliable as brick and mortar companies.
